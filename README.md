In this analysis, I analyzed the health and demographics of patients at a hospital. I examined the data to answer questions such as:

  - The nurse director must know if they are subconsciously treating races differently.
  - explore the relationship between the number of lab procedures and time spent in the hospital. Specifically, they asked for a few, average, and many procedure groups.
  - Give the hospital director a list of the medical specialties that have an average number of procedure count above 2.5 with the total procedure count above 50.
  - Provide a list of all patients who had an emergency but left the hospital faster than the average.
  - Research needs a list of all patient numbers who are African-American or have an "Up" to metformin
  - The healthcare data analyst boss wants to know what the distribution of time spent in the hospital looks like.
  - The healthcare data analyst boss is also curious to know if the majority stay less than 7 days. Once patients stay over 7 days, the hospital wants to ensure these patients are very acute.
